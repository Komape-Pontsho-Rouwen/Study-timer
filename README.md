A simple, elegant, and fully responsive 
web based study timer built using 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was originally created for 
someone close to me who struggles with a low
attention span, and it has since grown 
into a practical tool for maintaining focus 
using short study sessions paired with breaks.
The timer works on the Pomodoro principle 
study for a set period, take a break, and repeat helping 
users stay disciplined and calm 
while working.
